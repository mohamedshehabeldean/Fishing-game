Here is the key used in our project :

- `Esc` key: Pressing this key will exit the game. It terminates the program and 
closes the game window.
- `p` key: Pressing this key will display the current score and time in the console. 
It prints the score value and the elapsed time since the game started.
- Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) : These keys are used to control the boat 
and the rod movement.

- `F1` key: Pressing this key toggle the full-screen mode of the game window. 
When the game is in full-screen mode, pressing `F1` again will revert it back to 
the windowed mode
